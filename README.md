# Airbnb_Data
This project uses SQL and Python to analyze a 100,000-record Airbnb dataset, focusing on trends in pricing, property types, review scores, and availability across cities. Key insights support data-driven decision-making for hosts and guests. Future work could include predictive models and dashboard creation.
